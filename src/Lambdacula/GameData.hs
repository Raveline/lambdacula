ldRooms = [Room "In front of the castle" "You're standing in front of the castle of Lambdacula, in the heart of transylvania. It is standing at the top of a moutain, as any proper gothic castle should be. In front of you, to the south, the gates of the castle lead to the inner yard. I could describe the howling wind, the eerie atmosphere, the uncanny mist, the noise of flapping bats and other items from my Dictionnary Of Transylvanian ClichÃ©s, but I think you've got the idea. To the south, you'll find the gate of the castle, that you can cross to enter into an inner yard. On the east, a little path should lead you to safety or towards new adventures, but, come on, try to finish this one first." Nada
        -- FIRST FLOOR.
        , Room "The southern gate" "This is the inner yard of the castle. Obviously, count Lambdacula must have financial trouble, or his skills in household management are more than lacking. The place is a wreck, let's face it. There is an awful stench everywhere, rats are running through the place, the windows are dusty and frankly, UNESCO World Heritage Centre would be appalled by this place." Nada
        , Room "The castle entrance" "This is the southern part of the inner yard of the castle. Like the rest of the yard, it's but a shadow of its former glory. The yard is covered with the cobblestones. The little steps leading to the main doors of the castle are covered with cracks. As for the castle, frankly, you're amazed it has not yet collapsed. Time must have forgotten to destroy everything here." Nada
        , Room "The kitchen" "You're standing in a vast room, specifically designed to the production of fine food. Well, it used to be, because like everything else here, it has seen better days. Everything food related has been eaten by rats, insects and even less pleasant animals. Dusty or broken tableware lay on the tables. Empty, opened cupboard made out of rotting wood are waiting for a mercyful soul to chop their soul out of here. Needless to say, there is no fridge, no coffee machine, not the slightest touch of modern comfort. Making anything edible in here would be quite a feat." Nada
        , Room "The guard room" "In the Middle-Ages, this room would have been packed with tough looking men-at-arms, patrolling merrily, freezing their asses around the braseros, singing politically incorrect songs. Nowadays, it's just a big room, almost empty, though the braseros are still there. It's a big room with six heavy columns. Though the walls are sometimes cracked, you think it's not going to crumble before long, so feel free to frolick around as much as you need. Against the southern wall, you notice a narrow round staircase leading to an upper floor." Nada
        , Room "The dormitory" "This used to be a place where the guards would sleep. Arrow slits let the light from the outside shine in. There are twenty beds, and straw mattresses, or what's left of them. Though you notice one of the beds is very neatly done. There is also a little do-it-yourself hearth, with a cooking pot. And next to it... " Nada
        , Room "A gallery" "This is a long corridor used to display the portraits of the former masters of the castle. This place is not too bad. There is a ceremonial red, velevty rug on the floor, that the rats almost didn't use as their privy. Beautiful chandeliers hang from the ceiling. Of course there are no candles anymore, but little windows give you enough light to be able to look around. On the walls, sixteen paintings of the former Lords of Lambdacula and their spouses. Look, they are all here !" Nada
        , Room "Antichamber" "This is a little antichamber or vestibule. I never understood exactly why castle would have this kind of rooms. What on earth did they use it for ? Well if it had any kind of use in the old days, it has none whatsoever today. The place is just a boring old room, with light coming from dusty windows showing the inner yard of the castle. There is a mosaic on the floor, but it is so ugly I decided I'm not going to describe it. On the walls, squatters have drawn graffiti like \"No more garlic\" or \"Transylvannia rulez\". Nothing worth your time." Nada
        , Room "A muddy path" "You're walking along a path that goes down the mountain of Lambda, where the castle of Lambdacula was built. You'd like follow the path onwards and leave this dreadful place to go back to civilization but a strange feeling prevent you from... oh, who am I kidding ? You can't escape, you coward, you've got to face the count and murder him, because this is the goal of this sick, twisted, vampirophobic videogame. If you've got an issue with that, just type \"quit\" and be gone.\nWhere was I ? So, yes, the path could let you get away. The only interesting place here is a shack. It's most likely where the gamekeeper of Count Lambdacula used to live. Well, there is the slight possibility that the gamekeeper is immortal and still lives there, so you never know, that's the issue with undeads." Nada
        , Room "The gamekeeper shack" "You're inside a simple shack made out of rudimentary logs. Everything is covered with spider webs. Apparently, no one has been there for a long time, though you could swear there are some footsteps on the dusty floorboards. On the wall opposite to the door, there is something that must have been a bed long ago. Next to it, a night table. There is also a cupboard, a diner table that was half-eaten by termites and a big bucket that must have been used for some very basic form of washing up." Nada
        , Room "The dining room" "You're standing in Castle Lambdacula formal dining room. You're quite sure that even before this place was crumbling, hell, even before the Count of Lambdacula became a vampire, this room was already sinister. An enormous, wooden table reinforced with iron stands in the middle. Chairs forged from iron, with impressive and, let's be frank, monstrous creativity surround it. And I don't want to make unwanted comments about the way things are in this castle, but really, if you had to pick a dining room, would you go with the one with a terrible draught ?" Nada
        , Room "The living room" "You're standing in a vast and cosy living room. Strangely enough, this particular room is in a perfect state. The armchairs and sofa are still there, and not invaded by spiderwebs. It is as if some people used this room regularly. Well, after all, if they are vampire in this castle, it is normal that they should have a place to meet and talk together, you know." Nada
        , Room "The library" "You're standing in a nice library, perfectly preserved. The whole room is wood-paneled. There are two comfortable armchairs in the middle. From the windows, you can see the distant landscape of Transylvania. Once again, it looks like people have been using the place recently. It's nice, in this day and age, to know that there are some who still find comfort in intellectual activities, and will spend a lovely evening reading books. Well, considering the fact that most inhabitant of the castle must be vampires, they probably spend the night drinking blood of innocent bystanders, but you know, once it's done, they go to the library." Nada
        , Room "The hall" "This is the entrance hall of Lambdacula Castle. Well, it's not as grandiose as you could have expected, but it's not that bad. Particularly if you've got nothing against dark, eerie shadows or cobwebs, or the nasty feeling that someone is watching your every step. And stone, of course. You have to love stone to appreciate the place, because, except from one or two medieval armours, the only thing you're going to get here is stone. Everywhere." Nada 
        , Room "The smoking room" "This is a cosy little room, with nice furniture. It was the place where the men would go after a heavy diner, and somke the cigar and discuss matter of current politics. Or football. Or the latest xbox game. Or whatever. You notice a beautiful japanese inspired wallpaper. The windows on the east let you admire a little inner yard, with a garden." Nada
        , Room "The inner garden" "You are standing in a little inner yard, covered with flowers and dangerously untamed trees. There were once gravel alleys to walk ildly between the plants, but nature has a way to claim back everything, so I would advise against having a little stroll in this garden turned jungle." Nada
        , Room "The chapel" "This used to be the chapel of the castle, but there has been some major change, here. First of all, every crosses have been removed. How weird is that, huh ? Then it is obvious it's been a long time since anybody held a mass here. The benches are broken or knocked down." Nada
        , Room "Piano bar" "Ok, this is unexpected, but the castle has its own piano bar. Lovely place, covered with rugs. You see a nice Pleyel grand piano on the stage. Unfortunately, there are no bottle in the bar anymore. But there is a blackjack table ! With no players nor dealers, though, so, no, you're not going to get rich today." Nada
        , Room "The conservatory" "You're standing in a little greenhouse, dedicated to growing exotic plants and drinking tea. In both instance, the place fails miserably though. The plants are all dead - and dead as in long gone, not as living-dead. There are barely somme roots that survived the attacks of time, god knows how. As far as tea is concerned, there once was an ebony table, but it's been turned into a luxury restaurant for termites, and there is not much left." Nada
        -- 2ND FLOOR
        , Room "The countess bedroom" "Silk, velvet, tasteful tapestry on the wall, elegant dressing table : no doubt to have, you are in the countess bedroom. And boy, did she like purple. Everything here is purple : the wallpaper, the sheet on the bed, the rugs. You'd swear there is something wrong with your eyes. The room is very well cared for, which is quite strange come to think of it : the countess is supposed to have died five centuries ago, so you don't really see the need to do her room everyday." Nada
        , Room "The north-west corridor" "You are standing in a massive corridor. It probably served some defensive purpose a long time ago. You are above the guard room, and you can see that many openings were made to pour various burning fluids would the room beneath be conquered by assailants. The stairs that lead to the guard room are narrow and round, to make the defense easier." Nada
        , Room "The north-east corridor" "You're walking along the second floor corridor. Your steps are muffled by a thick rug that deserves a long trip to the dry-cleaner. The place is decorated without taste and with armours, armours everywhere. Why, oh why do they always feel the need to put armours everywhere in this old castles ? Don't they understand how clichÃ© the whole thing is ? Anyway. " Nada
        , Room "The amusement arcade" "OK, this is not exactly what you expected to find here. The Count of Lambdacula must have had this place installed in the 1980s. There are great video game oldies and pinballs here, and the lovely, obseding noise of a fifteen electronic chips making their own music at the same time. There is even the smell of cigarettes in the air, just like in the old times. " Nada
        , Room "The central corridor" "As you walk through this part of the second floor corridor, you have chilly feeling going down your spine (please ignore this comment if you are a mollusk). This can only mean two things : you are close to the Count's Lair... or there is a draught (or, as they would say in the colonies, \"a draft\"). Actually, you're close to the master bedroom, judging by the opulent golden candelstick stuck on the wall. Well, vampires can be so very nouveau riche, you know." Nada
        , Room "The master bedroom" "This used to be the bedroom of the count. Well, maybe it still is, but vampires are known to prefer the cosy comfort of a coffin to the silky pleasure of a decadent bed." Nada
        , Room "The countess bathroom" "It shall not be said that the transylvanian countryside is devoid of the comfort and sophistication of the modern life. This is a fully equipped bathroom, with an elegant porcelain bathtub." Nada
        , Room "The private living room" "This little cosy room was used by the family of the former Counts of the castle when they didn't entertain guests. There are only two armchairs and a two-sitter." Nada 
        -- UNDERGROUND WORLD
        , Room "A dark corridor" "You're walking on a creepy natural corridor. Far-away sounds, echoing through the walls, give you the creeps. You know, there is a ladder right behind you, leading to a hatch, that will allow you to leave this underground madness. I'm just saying. Nobody will be judging you if you act like a coward. I mean not everyone is cut out to be a hero, right ? Let's face it, you should be working in a cubicle, right now. Not dwelve in the heart of a Transylvanian mountain, where some monsters will most likely tear your chest apart and make a supper out of your brain.\nAnyway, the corridor continues to the south. In the darkness. With lots of creepy sounds. Not to scare you or anything." Dark]
