I could describe the howling wind, the eerie atmosphere, the uncanny mist, the noise of flapping bats and other items from my Dictionnary Of Transylvanian ClichÃ©s, but I think you've got the idea. To the south, you'll find the gate of the castle, that you can cross to enter into an inner yard.

There is an awful stench everywhere, rats are running through the place, the windows are dusty and frankly, UNESCO World Heritage Centre would be appalled by this place.

You can't escape, you coward, you've got to face the count and murder him, because this is the goal of this sick, twisted, vampirophobic videogame. If you've got an issue with that, just type \"quit\" and be gone.\nWhere was I ? So, yes, the path could let you go away. The only interesting place here is a shack. It's most likely where the gamekeeper of Count Lambdacula used to live. Well, there is the slight possibility that the gamekeeper is immortal and still lives there, so you never know, that's the issue with undeads."

Apparently, no one has been there for a long time, though you could swear there are some footsteps on the dusty floorboards. On the wall opposite to the door, there is something that must have been a bed long ago. Next to it, a night table with an old copy of \"Lady's Chatterley's Lover\". There is also a cupboard, a diner table that was half-eaten by termites and a big bucket that must have been used for some very basic form of washing up.
