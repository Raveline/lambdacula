ldRooms = [Room "In front of the castle" "You're standing in front of the castle of Lambdacula, in the heart of transylvania. It is standing at the top of a moutain, as any proper gothic castle should be. In front of you, to the south, the gates of the castle lead to the inner yard. I could describe the howling wind, the eerie atmosphere, the uncanny mist, the noise of flapping bats and other items from my Dictionnary Of Transylvanian ClichÃ©s, but I think you've got the idea. To the south, you'll find the gate of the castle, that you can cross to enter into an inner yard. On the east, a little path should lead you to safety or towards new adventures, but, come on, try to finish this one first." Nada
        -- FIRST FLOOR.
        , Room "The southern gate" "This is the inner yard of the castle. Obviously, count Lambdacula must have financial trouble, or his skills in household management are more than lacking. The place is a wreck, let's face it. There is an awful stench everywhere, rats are running through the place, the windows are dusty and frankly, UNESCO World Heritage Centre would be appalled by this place." Nada
        , Room "The castle entrance" "This is the souther part of the inner yard of the castle. As the rest of the yard, it's but a shadow of its former glory. Cobblestones are laying on the ground. The little stair leading to the main doors of the castle are covered with cracks. As for the castle, frankly, you're amazed it has not yet collapsed. Time must have forgotten to destroy everything here." Nada
        , Room "The kitchen" "You're standing in a vast room, specifically designed to the production of fine food. Well, it used to be, because like everything else here, it has seen better days. Everything food related has been eaten by rats, insects and even less pleasant animals. Dusty or broken tableware lay on the tables. Empty, opened cupboard made out of rotting wood are waiting for a mercyful soul to chop their soul out of here. Needless to say, there is no fridge, no coffee machine, not the slightest touch of modern comfort. Making anything edible in here would be quite a feat." Nada
        , Room "The guard room" "In the middle age, this room would have been packed with tough looking men-at-arms, patrolling merrily, freezing their asses around the braseros, singing politically uncorrect songs. Nowadays, it's just a big room, almost empty, though the braseros are still there. It's a big room with six heavy columns. Though the walls are sometimes cracked, you think it's not going to crumble before long, so feel free to frolick around as much as you need." Nada
        , Room "The dormitory" "This used to be a place where the guards would sleep. Arrowlet vaguely let the outer light enter. There are twenty beds, and straw mattress, or what's left of them. Though you notice one of the bed is very neatly done. There is also a little do-it-yourself hearth, with a cooking pot. And next to it... " Nada
        , Room "A gallery" "This is a long corridor used to display the portraits of the former master of the castle. This place is not too bad. There is a ceremonial red, velevty rug on the floor, that the rats almost didn't use as their privy. Beautiful chandelier hang from the ceiling. Of course there is no candle anymore, but little windows give you enough light to be able to look around. On the walls, sixteen paintings of the former Lords of Lambdacula and their spouses. Look, they are all here !" Nada
        , Room "Antichamber" "This is a little antichamber or vestibule. I never understood exactly why castle would have this kind of rooms. What on earth did they use it for ? Well if it had any kind of use in the old days, it has none whatsoever today. The place is just a boring old room, with light coming from dusty windows showing the inner yard of the castle. There is a mosaic on the floor, but it is so ugly I decided I'm not going to describe it. On the walls, squatters have drawn graffiti like \"No more garlic\" or \"Transylvannia rulez\". Nothing worth your time." Nada
        , Room "A muddy path" "You're walking along a path that goes down the mountain of Lambda, where the castle of Lambdacula was built. You'd like follow the path onwards and leave this dreadful place to go back to civilization but a strange feeling prevent you from... oh, who am I kidding ? You can't escape, you coward, you've got to face the count and murder him, because this is the goal of this sick, twisted, vampirophobic videogame. If you've got an issue with that, just type \"quit\" and be gone.\nWhere was I ? So, yes, the path could let you get away. The only interesting place here is a shack. It's most likely where the gamekeeper of Count Lambdacula used to live. Well, there is the slight possibility that the gamekeeper is immortal and still lives there, so you never know, that's the issue with undeads." Nada
        , Room "The gamekeeper shack" "You're inside a simple shack made out of rudimentary logs. Everything is covered with spider webs. Apparently, no one has been there for a long time, though you could swear there are some footsteps on the dusty floorboards. On the wall opposite to the door, there is something that must have been a bed long ago. Next to it, a night table. There is also a cupboard, a diner table that was half-eaten by termites and a big bucket that must have been used for some very basic form of washing up." Nada
        , Room "The dining room" "You're standing in Castle Lambdacula formal dining room. You're quite sure that even before this place was crumbling, hell, even before the Count of Lambdacula became a vampire, this room was already sinister. An enormous, wooden table reinforced with iron stands in the middle. Chairs forged from iron, with impressive and, let's be frank, monstrous creativity surround it. And I don't want to make unwanted comments about the way things are in this castle, but really, if you had to pick a dining room, would you go with the one with a terrible draught ?" Nada
        , Room "The living room" "You're standing in a vast and cosy living room. Strangely enough, this particular room is in perfect state. The armchairs and sofa are still there, and not invaded by spiderwebs. It is as if some people used this room regularly. Well, after all, if they are vampire in this castle, it is normal that they should have a place to meet and talk together, you know." Nada
        , Room "The library" "You're standing in a nice library, perfectly preserved. The whole room is wood-paneled. There are two comfortable armchairs in the middle. From the windows, you can see the distant landscape of Transylvania. Once again, it looks like people have been using the place recently. It's nice, in this day and age, to know that there are some who still find comfort in intellectual activities, and will spend a lovely evening reading books. Well, considering the fact that most inhabitant of the castle must be vampires, they probably spend the night drinking blood of innocent bystanders, but you know, once it's done, they go to the library." Nada
        -- UNDERGROUND WORLD
        , Room "A dark corridor" "You're walking on a creepy natural corridor. Far-away sounds, echoing through the walls, give you the creeps. You know, there is a ladder right behind you, leading to a hatch, that will allow you to leave this underground madness. I'm just saying. Nobody will be judging you if you act like a coward. I mean not everyone is cut out to be a hero, right ? Let's face it, you should be working in a cubicle, right now. Not dwelve in the heart of a Transylvanian mountain, where some monsters will most likely tear your chest apart and make a supper out of your brain.\nAnyway, the corridor continues to the south. In the darkness. With lots of creepy sounds. Not to scare you or anything." Dark]
